                Organizations are increasingly expected to be able to justify how a product was created. Is it really as green as claimed? Is there certainly no child labor involved? What was the CO2 emission of this shirt? Can the batteries of my
                electric car be reused or recycled? And what is their residual value?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>These questions also find their way to policymakers, where as part of the green deal the <strong>Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP)</strong> has been set up, an initiative to make Europe the world's first circular economy by 2050.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>To achieve this policy goal and to answer questions in society and organizations, there are two important questions that need to be answered.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How can products be used again at the end of their lifespan: recycle, reuse, repair, etc.?</li>
                <li>What are the current insights into the circular economy, with which policymakers can make good and targeted policy?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                Fortunately, both questions, just like the social issues, can be addressed with a combination of technology and agreements, the so-called Digital Product Passports. This is a standardized digital document in a collaborative digital
                infrastructure that keeps track of where a product comes from, how it was created, and where it is going. Even if the product passes through different companies or through different sectors, it keeps track of its origin. This makes it
                possible to determine where your clothing was made, to make a statement about the expected quality of a semi-finished product, or to recall products in a very targeted manner in the event of a production error.

                Together with groups of partners from various sectors, TNO is investigating how Digital Product Passports can be realized and how new regulations can best be met. We do this through technical research and development work,
                facilitating partnerships between organizations and connecting the European objectives and their impact on Dutch organizations.

            Digital Product Passports (DPP) are digital documents that provide detailed, transparent information about a product’s entire lifecycle. From design and materials to manufacturing and end-of-life disposal, DPPs offer a comprehensive
            overview to enhance sustainability, traceability, and consumer trust.
